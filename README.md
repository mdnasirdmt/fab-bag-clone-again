How I cloned FAB-BAG Website:

First, I built a homepage. On the homepage I have created a Navbar,header,logo SUBSCRIBE NOW, I have fixed a homepage page link like whenever a customer will click on a logo then he will get Subscribe for Month . After that, I have created a fixed navbar on top logo some auto-timer depending on the slider image which looks more pretty, and then I have added some pictures related to Fab-Bag products which will be available on the Fab-Bag website. After that, I have added a SUBSCRIPTION, on the website.
